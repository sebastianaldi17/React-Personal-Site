# Personal Site created using React.js
This was a small side project of mine, to create another personal website using React.js. It was a learning experience for me, especially trying out material-UI for the first time (after getting used to bootstrap, it feels familiar yet foreign).

Site is ~~hosted at netlify~~ no longer hosted, new personal site is a work in progress.
