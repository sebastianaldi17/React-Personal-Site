# Personal Site created using React.js
This was a small side project of mine, to create another personal website using React.js. It was a learning experience for me, especially trying out material-UI for the first time (after getting used to bootstrap, it feels familiar yet foreign). I also plan on trying to host this site to Netlify (since I still want to keep my old site for historic purposes).

# Some things I plan on fixing/changing
- Try to utilize more of the `@material-ui/icons` library, since it would be kind of a waste if I only used a few.
- Separate data.json into multiple files based on the content (project list, timeline, etc.)
- Maybe add a blog if I feel like writing. I still want to think about how to make a blog from json content by myself...
- Any advice would be great.
